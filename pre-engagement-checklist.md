# Pre-Engagement Checklist

Before starting a penetration test, ensure that you have completed the following tasks to set the stage for a smooth and effective engagement.

1. **Define Scope and Objectives**
   - **Identify Target Systems**: Determine IP ranges, domains, applications, and networks to be tested.
   - **Clarify Goals**: Understand the goals of the penetration test (e.g., vulnerability identification, data exfiltration, RCE).

2. **Obtain Authorization**
   - **Written Permission**: Secure written authorization from the client to perform the penetration test.
   - **Signed Legal Agreements**: Ensure that legal agreements, such as NDAs and contracts, are signed.

3. **Establish Rules of Engagement (RoE)**
   - **Scope Limits**: Define what is in scope and out of scope (e.g., specific systems or applications excluded).
   - **Testing Restrictions**: Outline any restrictions on testing techniques (e.g., denial-of-service attacks, social engineering).
   - **Time Constraints**: Set timelines for the engagement, including start and end dates.

4. **Understand the Environment**
   - **Network Topology**: Gather information on the network architecture, including internal and external networks.
   - **System Inventory**: Obtain a list of systems, applications, and services in scope.

5. **Coordinate with the Client**
   - **Point of Contact**: Identify and establish communication with a primary contact person for the client.
   - **Emergency Procedures**: Understand the client's procedures for emergency situations (e.g., service outages, critical vulnerabilities).

6. **Identify and Gather Required Resources**
   - **Access Credentials**: Obtain necessary access credentials or user accounts if applicable.
   - **Tools and Equipment**: Prepare and configure tools required for the engagement (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks).

7. **Confirm Testing Window**
   - **Scheduling**: Confirm the agreed-upon testing window and ensure that it aligns with the clientâ€™s business operations.
   - **Notifications**: Inform relevant stakeholders about the testing schedule to prevent unnecessary disruptions.

8. **Review Legal and Compliance Requirements**
   - **Legal Constraints**: Verify any legal or regulatory constraints that might affect the testing (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
   - **Compliance Standards**: Ensure that the testing approach complies with industry standards and guidelines.

9. **Prepare a Test Plan**
   - **Testing Approach**: Define the methodology and approach to be used (e.g., black-box, white-box).
   - **Testing Phases**: Outline the different phases of the test (e.g., reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation).

10. **Risk Assessment**
    - **Identify Risks**: Assess potential risks associated with the test (e.g., accidental downtime, data loss).
    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks.

11. **Confirm Communication Channels**
    - **Reporting Channels**: Establish how findings will be communicated to the client.
    - **Incident Reporting**: Set up a process for reporting critical vulnerabilities or incidents discovered during testing.

12. **Review and Test Tools**
    - **Tool Updates**: Ensure all tools are up-to-date and properly configured.
    - **Test Environment**: Test tools in a controlled environment to verify they work as expected.

13. **Develop a Contingency Plan**
    - **Fallback Procedures**: Create procedures for handling unexpected issues or interruptions during the test.
    - **Escalation Procedures**: Define escalation paths for critical issues that need immediate attention.

14. **Confirm Data Handling Procedures**
    - **Data Storage**: Define how test data will be stored securely.
    - **Data Disposal**: Establish procedures for securely disposing of data after the engagement.

15. **Prepare Reporting Templates**
    - **Report Format**: Choose or develop templates for reporting findings (e.g., executive summary, technical details).
    - **Content Guidelines**: Define the content to be included in the report (e.g., risk levels, remediation recommendations).

16. **Set Up Monitoring and Logging**
    - **Monitor Testing Activities**: Set up monitoring to track testing activities and ensure they are within scope.
    - **Log Activities**: Ensure that all activities are logged for later review and audit purposes.

17. **Review Previous Engagements**
    - **Historical Data**: Review previous penetration testing reports or assessments if available.
    - **Known Vulnerabilities**: Identify known issues or vulnerabilities from prior tests.

18. **Plan for Client Feedback**
    - **Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a method for the client to provide feedback during and after the engagement.
    - **Follow-Up**: Plan for follow-up discussions or meetings to address any questions or concerns.

19. **Verify Insurance Coverage**
    - **Liability Insurance**: Confirm that both the testing organization and client have appropriate insurance coverage for potential issues.

20. **Final Pre-Engagement Review**
    - **Checklist Review**: Ensure that all items on this checklist are completed.
    - **Approval**: Obtain final approval from all relevant parties to proceed with the engagement.

This checklist will help ensure that you have covered all essential aspects before beginning a penetration testing engagement, setting the stage for a successful and well-organized test.
