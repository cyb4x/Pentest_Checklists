# Pre-Engagement Checklist

Before starting a penetration test, ensure that you have completed the following tasks to set the stage for a smooth and effective engagement.

- [ ] **Define Scope and Objectives**
  - [ ] Identify Target Systems: Determine IP ranges, domains, applications, and networks to be tested.
  - [ ] Clarify Goals: Understand the goals of the penetration test (e.g., vulnerability identification, data exfiltration, RCE).

- [ ] **Obtain Authorization**
  - [ ] Written Permission: Secure written authorization from the client to perform the penetration test.
  - [ ] Signed Legal Agreements: Ensure that legal agreements, such as NDAs and contracts, are signed.

- [ ] **Establish Rules of Engagement (RoE)**
  - [ ] Scope Limits: Define what is in scope and out of scope (e.g., specific systems or applications excluded).
  - [ ] Testing Restrictions: Outline any restrictions on testing techniques (e.g., denial-of-service attacks, social engineering).
  - [ ] Time Constraints: Set timelines for the engagement, including start and end dates.

- [ ] **Understand the Environment**
  - [ ] Network Topology: Gather information on the network architecture, including internal and external networks.
  - [ ] System Inventory: Obtain a list of systems, applications, and services in scope.

- [ ] **Coordinate with the Client**
  - [ ] Point of Contact: Identify and establish communication with a primary contact person for the client.
  - [ ] Emergency Procedures: Understand the client's procedures for emergency situations (e.g., service outages, critical vulnerabilities).

- [ ] **Identify and Gather Required Resources**
  - [ ] Access Credentials: Obtain necessary access credentials or user accounts if applicable.
  - [ ] Tools and Equipment: Prepare and configure tools required for the engagement (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks).

- [ ] **Confirm Testing Window**
  - [ ] Scheduling: Confirm the agreed-upon testing window and ensure that it aligns with the clientâ€™s business operations.
  - [ ] Notifications: Inform relevant stakeholders about the testing schedule to prevent unnecessary disruptions.

- [ ] **Review Legal and Compliance Requirements**
  - [ ] Legal Constraints: Verify any legal or regulatory constraints that might affect the testing (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
  - [ ] Compliance Standards: Ensure that the testing approach complies with industry standards and guidelines.

- [ ] **Prepare a Test Plan**
  - [ ] Testing Approach: Define the methodology and approach to be used (e.g., black-box, white-box).
  - [ ] Testing Phases: Outline the different phases of the test (e.g., reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation).

- [ ] **Risk Assessment**
  - [ ] Identify Risks: Assess potential risks associated with the test (e.g., accidental downtime, data loss).
  - [ ] Mitigation Strategies: Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks.

- [ ] **Confirm Communication Channels**
  - [ ] Reporting Channels: Establish how findings will be communicated to the client.
  - [ ] Incident Reporting: Set up a process for reporting critical vulnerabilities or incidents discovered during testing.

- [ ] **Review and Test Tools**
  - [ ] Tool Updates: Ensure all tools are up-to-date and properly configured.
  - [ ] Test Environment: Test tools in a controlled environment to verify they work as expected.

- [ ] **Develop a Contingency Plan**
  - [ ] Fallback Procedures: Create procedures for handling unexpected issues or interruptions during the test.
  - [ ] Escalation Procedures: Define escalation paths for critical issues that need immediate attention.

- [ ] **Confirm Data Handling Procedures**
  - [ ] Data Storage: Define how test data will be stored securely.
  - [ ] Data Disposal: Establish procedures for securely disposing of data after the engagement.

- [ ] **Prepare Reporting Templates**
  - [ ] Report Format: Choose or develop templates for reporting findings (e.g., executive summary, technical details).
  - [ ] Content Guidelines: Define the content to be included in the report (e.g., risk levels, remediation recommendations).

- [ ] **Set Up Monitoring and Logging**
  - [ ] Monitor Testing Activities: Set up monitoring to track testing activities and ensure they are within scope.
  - [ ] Log Activities: Ensure that all activities are logged for later review and audit purposes.

- [ ] **Review Previous Engagements**
  - [ ] Historical Data: Review previous penetration testing reports or assessments if available.
  - [ ] Known Vulnerabilities: Identify known issues or vulnerabilities from prior tests.

- [ ] **Plan for Client Feedback**
  - [ ] Feedback Mechanism: Establish a method for the client to provide feedback during and after the engagement.
  - [ ] Follow-Up: Plan for follow-up discussions or meetings to address any questions or concerns.

- [ ] **Verify Insurance Coverage**
  - [ ] Liability Insurance: Confirm that both the testing organization and client have appropriate insurance coverage for potential issues.

- [ ] **Final Pre-Engagement Review**
  - [ ] Checklist Review: Ensure that all items on this checklist are completed.
  - [ ] Approval: Obtain final approval from all relevant parties to proceed with the engagement.

This checklist ensures that you have covered all essential aspects before beginning a penetration testing engagement.
